# Q1: Two values of boolean data type are, TRUE and FALSE.

# Q2: And, or and not are three types of boolean operators.

# Q3: Condition 1(C1) : TRUE ;Condition 2(C2): TRUE== AND --> TRUE , OR --> TRUE & NOT (C1 for eg) --> FALSE
# C1: TRUE C2: FALSE == AND --> FALSE , OR --> TRUE & NOT (C1 for eg) --> FALSE
# C1: FALSE C2: FALSE == AND --> FALSE , OR --> FALSE & NOT (C1 for eg) --> TRUE
# C1: FALSE C2: TRUE == AND --> FALSE , OR --> TRUE & NOT (C1 for eg) --> TRUE

# Q4: FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE

# Q5: Less than (<), More than (>), Less than or equal to (<=), More than or equal to (>=), Equal to (==) and Not equal to (!=)

# Q6: In an assignment operator we use single equal sign (=) whereas during comparison we use double (==). E.g.: a = 10 (assignment operator) whereas if a == 10: do something (comparison).

# Q7: spam = 0 ----> (Assignment 1st block)
# if spam == 10: ----> (Comparison 2nd block)
#     print("eggs")
# if spam > 5:----> (Comparison 3rd block)
#     print("bacon")
# else:
#     print("ham")
# print("spam")
# print("spam")

# Q8: Spam = 0
# if Spam == 1:
#         print("Hello")
# elif Spam == 2:
#     print("Howdy")
# else:
#     print("Greetings")

# Q9: Stop key and restart the kernal.

# Q10: Break, breaks the loop and goes to the next loop for execution. Whereas, continue starts the next iteration.

# Q11: There no difference between the output of all 3 statements.

# Q12: Program 1(for loop): for i in range(1,11):
#         print(i)
#         
# Program 2(while loop)
# i=1
# while i < 11:
#     print(i)
#     i+=1

# Q13: spam.bacon()
